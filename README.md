In this code i have created a game using a few images

we first by entering the information of the images so that the code can register the images as objects

i then wrote the code so the program was able to get the size of the images.

I then gave the player image a location to spawn in and gave all enemies a random position to spawn from and move towards the enemy at different speeds

i aslo gave the prize image a random location to spawn and move slowly towards the player.

The player would lose if he collided with any of the enemy objects but would win if he managed to collide with the prize image
